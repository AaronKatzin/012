# 012
*012* is a little logic game developed by computer science students @ Holon Institute of Technology, HIT.  
The user is presented with a board of tiles, and he must fill them following these simple rules:  
 - Three adjacent tiles of the same color in a row or column isnâ€™t allowed.  
 - Rows and columns must have an equal number of each color.  
 - No two rows and no two columns can be the same.
